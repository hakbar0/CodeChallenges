# Code Challenges

Welcome to MultiLangCodeKatas, a repository where I tackle coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode and CodeWars using multiple programming languages. The goal of this repository is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new programming concepts, and become proficient in different programming languages.

## Languages Covered

- **Go**
- **TypeScript**
- **Java**
- **Python**

Each language directory contains solutions and unit tests for problems from both LeetCode and CodeWars.
